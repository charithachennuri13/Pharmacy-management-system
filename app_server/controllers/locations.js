      { author: 'Nani Nalli', rating: 5, timestamp: '2013-07-16', reviewText: 'I recently visited Apollo Pharmacy and had a largely positive experience. The store was clean, well-organized, and stocked with a wide range of products, from prescription medications to health supplements. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful, providing detailed information about the medications I needed. Pricing was competitive, with various discounts and a beneficial membership program. While the prescription filling process was smooth and efficient, some items were out of stock, which was a minor inconvenience. Additionally, the online services, including home delivery and prescription uploads, were user-friendly, although tracking could be improved. Overall, Apollo Pharmacy offers reliable service and a pleasant shopping experience, making it a recommended choice for health-related needs.' },
